MISSION BRIEFING FOR EGGSHIELD AGENT:

Lucy is an avid fan of ROOTCON and is also an agent of Eggshield.

She was tasked to protect the Power Egg to protect it from thieves who would use it for evil purposes.

Our insiders from the multiverse were informed that she encrypted the data about the Power Egg using Advanced Earth Shenanigans.

They also told us the pattern of the password she used; composed of the following:
    a year
    her favorite ROOTCON Goon
    her favorite color (which is quite unique!)

For example:
    2020-Methadone-teal

Moreover, they also acquired the hash of Lucy's password. See below:
    34d5cf6ecc220ab4c31d90f41f07c9a1

That's all we can give you.

Good luck!
-Eggshield
